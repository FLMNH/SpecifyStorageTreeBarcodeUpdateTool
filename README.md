Specify Storage Tree Barcode Update Tool

This tool updates items’ storage location in the Specify database by simply scanning the shelf label barcode 
followed by scanning the barcodes of the items on the shelf. The software remembers the last shelf until a new 
shelf label is scanned. This affords rapid real time updating of the Specify database as the process involves 
no keyboard entry or mouse use.
